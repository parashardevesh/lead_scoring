# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Overview
X Education, an online education company, aims to increase its lead conversion rate by identifying the most promising leads. The goal of this project was to build a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. The higher the score, the more likely the lead is to convert. The CEO has set a target lead conversion rate of around 80%.

## Problem Statement
X Education receives many leads daily, but only about 30% convert into paying customers. To enhance efficiency, the company wants to focus on 'Hot Leads'â€”those with the highest conversion probability. By focusing on these leads, the company hopes to improve its overall conversion rate.

## Data
The dataset consists of approximately 9,000 entries with 34 feature variables and one target variable (`Converted`). The features include information like Lead Origin, Lead Source, Last Activity, and more.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Dropped Columns:** Removed columns with more than 35% missing values, redundant columns, and those with single values.
- **Missing Values:** Imputed missing values for categorical variables using the mode and for numerical variables using the median.
- **Outliers:** Performed capping on `TotalVisits` and `Page Views Per Visit` to handle outliers.
- **Feature Engineering:** Merged low-frequency categories and reduced the number of categories for several columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Conversion Rate:** Approximately 40% of the leads were converted, which was deemed acceptable for model building.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Most leads originated from the "Landing Page Submission" and "Google" sources.
  - Leads with "SMS Sent" as the last activity showed the highest conversion rate.
  - Unemployed individuals and those who didn't request a free copy of the course material were more likely to convert.

## Model Building
A logistic regression model was developed using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection and then insignificant variables were eliminated based on p-value. The final model achieved:
- **Training Set:** 81% accuracy with a precision of 73.8% and recall of 78%.
- **Test Set:** 80.9% accuracy with a precision of 75% and recall of 75.9%.

## Optimal Cutoff
- **ROC-AUC Analysis:** The optimal cutoff point was determined to be 0.369, yielding a balance between sensitivity (75.9%) and specificity (84%).

## Key Findings
- Variables that significantly impact lead conversion include `Total Time Spent on Website`, `Total Visits`, and `Page Views Per Visit`.
- Lead Origin, Lead Source, and Last Activity are also important factors.
- Leads with a score of 36 or higher have a high likelihood of conversion, with conversion rates of 87% and above.

## Conclusion
The model provides a reliable scoring system that can help X Education focus on leads with a high probability of conversion, thereby improving their overall efficiency and conversion rate.
